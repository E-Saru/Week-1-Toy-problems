    The project provides a function that prompts the user to input student marks. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a valid mark between 0 and 100. The output will display the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:
    A: Greater than 79
    B: 60 to 79
    C: 50 to 59
    D: 40 to 49
    E: Less than 40


    
    Challenge 2-Challenge 2: Speed Detector 

    The program takes the speed of a car as input and evaluates it according to the following rules:
    If the speed is less than 70, it prints: "Ok."
    For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
    If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints: "License suspended."


    Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

    The primary purpose of the program is to calculate an individual's Net Salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits. The calculator takes into account various deductions such as Payee (Tax), NHIF Deductions, and NSSF Deductions, providing a breakdown of the gross salary and net salary.
    Features
    Payee (Tax) Calculation: Utilizes tax brackets and rates to calculate the Payee (Tax) based on the provided KRA (Kenya Revenue Authority) guidelines.
    NHIF Deductions Calculation: Determines NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund) deductions based on the provided NHIF rates.
    NSSF Deductions Calculation: Calculates NSSF (National Social Security Fund) deductions using a fixed percentage.
    Gross and Net Salary Calculation: Computes the gross salary by summing up the basic salary and benefits. Net salary is then calculated by subtracting Payee, NHIF Deductions, and NSSF Deductions.
